### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Adam Scharf, a software developer in my day job who spends his free time playing too much fantasy baseball and fostering rescue cats with my wife. My goal for software is to grant independence to users so they can have the tools they need to make good decisions. I'd rather do things the interesting way than the fast way, but that's because I find the interesting way is usually more broadly applicable later.

### ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on ...
  - [The Ottoneu Toolbox](https://github.com/blue-shoes/ottoneu-toolbox): An all-in-one GUI for playing Ottoneu fantasy baseball
  - [Otto-bot](https://github.com/blue-shoes/Otto-bot): A Slack bot that uses AWS services to provide workflows for the Ottoneu Slack community.
  - [Weave Tracker](https://github.com/blue-shoes/weave-tracker): A utility app using a Raspberry Pico and a small display screen to track progress of weaving projects.
